# AdiBags-BetterCategories
# Baroque edit for Classic: WotLK 3.4, TBC 2.5 and Vanilla 1.14

The wonderful AdiBags addon contains a filter for automatically classifying
items by the categories and subcategories given by the game itself.
Unfortunately, the way the game categorizes items is often unhelpful. You
may have been annoyed in the past at the addon throwing all your ores, herbs,
and cloth onto one "Trade Goods" pile. This extra filter (written by stephenswat)
for AdiBags aims to solve this problem by using WowHead-inspired classifications,
as well as some further manual classifications, to make your inventory management
easier.

I (Baroque) have modified the excellent AdiBags-BetterCategories addon (original by
stephenswat) to feature WotLK and TBC items as well, to be used for Classic WotLK and TBC.
It uses even more fine-tuned categorization/auto sorting for Classic WotLK, TBC and Vanilla
content. It's modified for all the requirements of both leveling and raiding, presenting
inventory contents in a streamlined way.

This release of AdiBags-BetterCategories requires a base install of AdiBags,
be it on Classic WotLK 3.4.x, Burning Crusade 2.5.x or Vanilla 1.14.x. It works on all these
versions, adapting categories and sub-classifications to the content. It fits seamlessly
into the existing AdiBags framework, as it can be configured, re-ordered, and disabled
like any other AdiBags filter.

I've included specific categorization for over 4700 items:

- Approximately 1700 Vanilla items
- Approximately 1200 TBC items
- Approximately 1800 WotLK items

The general idea is that consumables which share buff slots or cooldowns are grouped into sub-categories. For instance:

- Buff food/drinks
- Flasks
- Battle Elixirs (TBC introduced sub-classification)
- Guardian Elixers (TBC introduced sub-classification)
- Scrolls
- Potions
- Runes
- Explosives
- Drums (TBC introduced)
- Weapon Buffs
- ...

This has been fine-tuned further over the original AdiBags-BetterCategories release.
Regular regenerative food & drinks are also split from (expensive) buff food.

Trade goods are split in sub-catergories as well, related to the appropriate professions,
as also seen in the original release.

Zone and/or faction specific reputation, gear & consumable quest tokens have been added,
also grouped into sub-categories, TBC examples:

- Aldor
- Scryer
- Honor Hold
- Thrallmar
- Cenarion Expedition
- Sporeggar
- Lower City
- The Consortium
- Halaa
- Ogri'la
- Sha'tari Skyguard
