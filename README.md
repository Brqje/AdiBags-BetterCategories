# AdiBags-BetterCategories for AdiBags Classic/BCC

The wonderful AdiBags addon contains a filter for automatically classifying
items by the categories and subcategories given my the game itself.
Unfortunately, the way the game categorizes items is often unhelpful. You
may have been annoyed in the past at the addon throwing all your ores, herbs,
and cloth onto one "Trade Goods" pile. This extra filter for AdiBags aims to
solve this problem by using WowHead-inspired classifications, as well as some
further manual classifications, to make your inventory management easier.

This addon fits seamlessly into the existing AdiBags framework, and can be
configured, re-ordered, and disabled like any other AdiBags filter.



# Baroque edit of AdiBags-BetterCategories for AdiBags Classic/BCC:

I've modded the excellent AdiBags-BetterCategories addon to feature TBC items, to be used for BCC.
It uses sensible categorization/auto sorting for both leveling and end-game Classic & Burning Crusade Classic content.
It's modified for all the requirements of a serious end-game raider, presenting inventory contents in a streamlined way.

It includes specific sorting for over 2200 items:

- Over 1600 items released in Vanilla
- Over 600 items released in TBC

The general idea is that consumables which share buff slots or cooldowns are grouped into sub-categories. For instance:

- Buff food/drinks
- Flasks
- Battle Elixirs (TBC introduced sub-classification)
- Guardian Elixers (TBC introduced sub-classification)
- Scrolls
- Potions
- Runes
- Drums
- Explosives
- Weapon Buffs
- ...

This has been fine tuned a bit more over the original AdiBags-BetterCategories release.
Regular regenerative food & drinks are also split from (expensive) buff food.

Trade goods are split in sub-catergories as well, related to the appropriate professions, as also seen in the original release.

Zone and/or faction specific reputation, gear & consumable quest tokens have been added, also grouped into sub-categories, TBC examples:

- Aldor
- Scryer
- Honor Hold
- Thrallmar
- Cenarion Expedition
- Sporeggar
- Lower City
- The Consortium
- Ogri'la
- Sha'tari Skyguard
