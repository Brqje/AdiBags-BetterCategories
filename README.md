# AdiBags-BetterCategories
# Baroque edit for Classic 1.13 & BCC 2.5:

The wonderful AdiBags addon contains a filter for automatically classifying
items by the categories and subcategories given by the game itself.
Unfortunately, the way the game categorizes items is often unhelpful. You
may have been annoyed in the past at AdiBags, throwing all your ores, herbs,
and cloth onto one "Trade Goods" pile. This extra filter (written by stephenswat)
for AdiBags aims to solve this problem by using WowHead-inspired classifications,
as well as some further manual classifications, to make your inventory management
easier.

The addon fits seamlessly into the existing AdiBags framework, it can be
configured, re-ordered, and disabled like any other AdiBags filter.

I (Baroque) have modified the excellent AdiBags-BetterCategories addon (original by
stephenswat) to feature TBC items as well, to be used for BCC. It uses even more
fine-tuned categorization/auto sorting for Classic 1.13.x & Burning Crusade Classic
2.5.x content. It's modified for all the requirements of both leveling and serious
end-game raiding, presenting inventory contents in a streamlined way.

I've spent many hours to include specific categorization for over 2200 items:

- Over 1600 items released in Vanilla
- Over 600 items released in TBC

The general idea is that consumables which share buff slots or cooldowns are grouped into sub-categories. For instance:

- Buff food/drinks
- Flasks
- Battle Elixirs (TBC introduced sub-classification)
- Guardian Elixers (TBC introduced sub-classification)
- Scrolls
- Potions
- Runes
- Explosives
- Drums
- Weapon Buffs
- ...

This has been fine-tuned further over the original AdiBags-BetterCategories release.
Regular regenerative food & drinks are also split from (expensive) buff food.

Trade goods are split in sub-catergories as well, related to the appropriate professions,
as also seen in the original release.

Zone and/or faction specific reputation, gear & consumable quest tokens have been added,
also grouped into sub-categories, TBC examples:

- Aldor
- Scryer
- Honor Hold
- Thrallmar
- Cenarion Expedition
- Sporeggar
- Lower City
- The Consortium
- Ogri'la
- Sha'tari Skyguard
